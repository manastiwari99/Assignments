        "Semantic HTML elements are HTML tags that convey meaning about the type of content they contain. Unlike non-semantic elements like `<div>` or` <span>`, which do not describe their content, semantic elements clearly describe their role in the document.\n",

        "**Examples of semantic HTML elements include:**\n",
        "\n",
        "`<header>` – Represents the header section of a document or section.\n",
        "\n",
        "`<nav>` – Defines a section for navigation links.\n",
        "\n",
        "`<main>` – Specifies the main content of the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "`<section>` – Represents a standalone section of content.\n",

        "`<article>` – Represents a self-contained piece of content (e.g., blog post).\n",
